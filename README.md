Breakfast Special is a new modpack by Caldin06, which is a lighter modpack using some lesser known/utilized mods to give a fresh feel to modded mine craft and tech with some more well known mods thrown in for ease of use.  This modpack feels like the old way of playing, where complex systems are needed to be built instead of tiny, easy to hide wires everywhere.  Based around Immersive Engineering and Magneticraft, along with TiCon for early game processing.

This pack contains Fastcraft (http://forum.industrial-craft.net/index.php?page=Thread&threadID=10820), by Player, enabled by default. Fastcraft enhances Minecraft with increased performance. Bug reports being made directly to Mod Authors should state Fastcraft is enabled.
